Each page features a **navigation bar** with responsive features.

* On the bottom left, the address of the gym.
* All pages other than sign up have a sign up offer and a call to action button taking the user to the signup page.
* There are also social media links to the bottom right.

There is another call to action button centre page just above the footer that will pop up a map of the gyms location.
